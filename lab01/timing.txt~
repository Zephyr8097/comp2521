EXPLAINATION:
             1. From the table above, it is obvious that the time used for sorting
                the number list taken by "sort -n" is much shorter than which taken
                 by the "useIntList", this might because the program I wrote in the
                "Intlist.c" is too prolix which will take longer time to get the 
                result. 
             2. Besides, the existance of the duplications do not cause too
                big effects to the result, this may because the program will ignore
                the duplication and only run for once.
             3. The number of the input will cause big effects to the result of
                the "useIntList", because with more input, the program will take
                longer time to compare each imput, but this opinion does not seems
                to work on the "sort -n", this might because the number of the 
                input is still not big enough to cuase the effect to the "sort -n".
             4. From the table we can see, the average time of the "sort -n" does
                not change too much, it is always between
