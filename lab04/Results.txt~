Notes (what the above indicates):
1. Inserting in ascending order using L and A methods will cost more comparations,
   because the shape of the tree is a straight line which is just like a link list.
   
2. Prefix Order using L method will take less comparations because it is a quite
   balanced already and inserting at leaves will not change its balance too much.
   
3. B method will take less comparations than the previous methods, because it is 
   always rebalancing the tree which will make searching easier.
   
4. Splay tree will "remember" the number that recently inserted and which will make
   the searching part easier.
   
5. AVL
